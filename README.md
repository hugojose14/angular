## How to create a component?


```mermaid
 graph TD
    id1["Create components"]
    id2["Handbook"]
    id3["Automatic (CLI)"]
    
    id1 --> id2
    id1 --> id3
    
```

#### Command for create a component 

Open your terminal and run next command
```bash
ng generate component name-component
#short form
ng g c name-component
#Command for create component inline (don't include html or css) 
ng g c name-component -s -t 
    
```

## Interpolation of string 

Interpolation refers to embedding expressions into marked up text. By default, interpolation uses the double curly braces {{ and }} as delimiters.

```html

currentCustomer = 'Maria';
<!--Use interpolation to display the value of this variable in the corresponding component template:-->
<h3>Current customer: {{ currentCustomer }}</h3>

<!--Angular replaces currentCustomer with the string value of the corresponding component property. In this case, the value is Maria.
-->

<p>{{title}}</p>
<div><img alt="item" src="{{itemImageUrl}}"></div>
```

## Run application (First App)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
